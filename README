# Language 1.5 revisited

At JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023, we've argued that Julia creates the "1.5 language problem". 
The goal back then has been to initiate a discussion--and numerous reactions show that a 
discussion has been initiated indeed. In this talk, we want to recap our original arguments, 
analyze and summarize the discussion that we've observed online and present some ideas where 
to take this from here.
